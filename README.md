# Running a React client application with the NodeJS API
For full details about the example React application see the post React + Redux - User Registration and Login Tutorial & Example. But to get up and running quickly just follow the below steps.

Download or clone the React tutorial code from https://github.com/cornflourblue/react-redux-registration-login-example
Install all required npm packages by running npm install from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
Remove or comment out the 2 lines below the comment // setup fake backend located in the /src/index.jsx file.
Start the application by running npm start from the command line in the project root folder, this will launch a browser displaying the application and it should be hooked up with the NodeJS + MongoDB API that you already have running.
